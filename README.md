## About
  Hello everybody, my name is Kenneth Escobar and I am a freshman attending University at Buffalo. I am currently 18 and was a former computer engineering major. I recently changed my major to Engineering Physics as I have found it more interesting and feel as if it calls to me more than coding. I was born in the United States of America but the rest of my family was born in Colombia. I was raised speaking Spanish due to this and I didn't learn English until primary school. 
  
## Skills
  I know how to read, write, and speak both English and Spanish. I have experience in money handling since I've worked in a gift shop for quite some time and also have experience in animation and drawing considering my brother is an art director and he's taught me a lot. I am very skilled in Excel, Powerpoint, and Word and am handy with computers as I have dealt with many computers and computer problems.
